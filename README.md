Using Services Instead of Cross-Component Outputs
=====================================================

In Angular, services are a powerful tool for sharing data and functionality between components. In this project, we have opted to use services instead of cross-component outputs to manage the flow of data. Here's why:

**Why Services?**

1. **Decoupling**: Services allow components to be decoupled from each other, making it easier to modify or replace individual components without affecting the rest of the application.
2. **Centralized Data Management**: Services provide a single source of truth for data, making it easier to manage and update data across the application.
3. **Reusability**: Services can be reused across multiple components, reducing code duplication and making it easier to maintain consistency.
4. **Easier Testing**: Services make it easier to test components in isolation, as they can be easily mocked or stubbed.

**How We Use Services**

In our project, we use services to manage the investment results data. The `InvestmentService` is responsible for calculating and storing the annual investment results. This service is then injected into the `InvestmentResultsComponent`, which uses the service to retrieve the results.

**Benefits in Our Project**

1. **Simplified Component Logic**: By using a service to manage the investment results, we have simplified the logic within the `InvestmentResultsComponent`, making it easier to understand and maintain.
2. **Easier Data Management**: The service provides a centralized location for managing the investment results data, making it easier to update or modify the data without affecting the component.
3. **Improved Testability**: The use of a service makes it easier to test the `InvestmentResultsComponent` in isolation, as we can easily mock the service to return specific data.

**Conclusion**

Using services instead of cross-component outputs has greatly improved the maintainability, testability, and scalability of our project. By centralizing data management and decoupling components, we have created a more robust and efficient application architecture.
